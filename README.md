# Eldridar, A Journey in Game Development
Eldridar(former Tavern Heroes) is a large-scope game development project created as a side hustle, highlighting the challenges of building an ambitious game with limited time and resources. It emphasizes creative problem-solving while leveraging efficient testing solutions tailored to the game development context to ensure quality, with a focus on detecting bugs that could otherwise cause system failures. The project explores fundamental coding principles, balancing trade-offs such as performance, memory usage, complexity, scalability, and readability. By prioritizing high cohesion over tight coupling, it incorporates design patterns and best practices to create extendable and maintainable C# code. Eldridar represents a continuous journey of enhancing technical skills and solving complex software challenges within the creative domain of game development.

Current Milestones: (swapping between programming, and Visual improvments to keep things fun and interesting)
Note: I am currently working on a different project with a smaller scope. I'll continue working on this game after the laucnh of Drykendalith's Descent.
0) **The project was just migrated to use unity's high definition renderpipine.**<br>
   Hopefully I can provide you with new Screenshots & Videos of gameplay footage!
1) **Swapping out Character Models, Animations, and Images in favor of higher quality Assets.**<br>
   So Theese new models and animations will improve visual aspects of the game.
   To all great 3D artist out there. Thank you for being there! allowing me to focus on the programming & problem solving side of things.
3) **Redesing of the skill tree**<br>
   The new skill tree will address the overly linear and unengaging design of the old system, offering greater flexibility, diverse player choices, and the freedom to create unique builds for a more enjoyable experience
4) **Automated Dungeon Generation**<br>
   The nature-themed domain and developing an algorithm that can automatically generate playable content. The algorithm's main focus is on creating randomly generated unique dungeons, which ensures a high replay potential for       gamers who are looking for endless exploration and adventure during each playthrough.

Eldridar combines strategic turn-based gameplay with the depth of the D20 system, delivering a rich and engaging experience. The game features highly replayable content, with late-game progression centered around increasing difficulty levels that boost the chances of forging better loot. Players can enjoy endless gear improvements, leveling, and diverse builds while making tactical decisions. With couch co-op support and a design tailored for both PC and console platforms, Eldridar offers an exciting and dynamic adventure. Old Content means: stay tuned for stunning new visuals!
